# UNIS

Application name: UNIS<br>
Platform: Web-based<br>
Version: 0.1<br>

UNIS is an experimental web-based application meant for sleep apnea patients. The application was done as a school project, but all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was self-written. Teachers only provided rough pointers. UNIS will be updated and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript refactored during the summer of 2023.
